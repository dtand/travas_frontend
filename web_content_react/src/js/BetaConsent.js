    </h5>
    <br/>
    <p>
        <strong>(a) Limited License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company

        grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, nontransferable license (without the right to sublicense)

        (i) to use the Beta Software in accordance with the Documentation solely for purposes of

        internal testing and evaluation, (ii) to use the Documentation provided with the Beta

        Software in support of Licensee’s authorized use of the Beta Software, and (iii) to copy Beta

        Software for archival or backup purposes, provided that all titles and trademarks, copyright,

    </p><br/>
    <p>
        <strong>(b) Evaluation Feedback.</strong> The purpose of this limited license is the testing and evaluation

        of the Beta Software and Documentation. In furtherance of this purpose, Licensee shall

        provide feedback to the Company concerning the functionality and performance of the Beta

        Software from time to time as reasonably requested by the Company, including, without

        foregoing, prior to Licensee disclosing to the Company any information in connection with

        this Agreement which Licensee considers proprietary or confidential, Licensee shall obtain

        the Company’s prior written approval to disclose such information to the Company, and

        without such prior written approval from the Company, Licensee shall not disclose any such

        information to the Company. Feedback and other information which is provided by Licensee

        to the Company in connection with the Beta Software or this Agreement may be used by the

        Company to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly, Licensee grants the

        Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license

        to use, reproduce, disclose, sublicense, distribute, modify, and otherwise exploit such

        Feedback and information without restriction.
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        <strong>(c) Restrictions.</strong> Licensee shall not copy or use the Beta Software (including the

        Documentation) or disseminate Confidential Information, as defined below, to any third

        party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Licensee will not, and will not permit

    <p>
        <strong>(d) Ownership.</strong> The Company shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the

        Intellectual Property Rights in the Beta Software and any derivative works thereof, subject

        only to the limited license expressly set forth in Section 2(a) hereof. Licensee does not

        3. TERM AND TERMINATION
    </h5>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Unless otherwise terminated as specified under this Agreement, Licensee’s rights with

        respect to the Beta Software will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the initial release by the

        Company of a generally available version of the Beta Software or (b) three months after

        any Licensee rights with respect to the Beta Software without notice in the event of

        improper disclosure of the Company’s Beta Software as specified under Section 4

        (Confidentiality) below. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the rights and

        licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and

        Licensee shall immediately cease using, and will return to the Company (or, at the

        Company’s request, destroy), the Beta Software, Documentation, and all other tangible

        items in Licensee’s possession or control that are proprietary to or contain Confidential

        Information. The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 2(b) 2(c), 2(d),

        strict confidence and not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as

        approved in writing by the Company and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose

        Beta Software test, agrees to maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and

        not to disclose Confidential Information to any person or organization until the date on

        which Company first makes this information publicly available ("Non-Disclosure Period").

        During the Non-Disclosure Period, Licensee additionally agrees not to disseminate, publish,

        or otherwise communicate any review, account, description or other information concerning

        the Beta Software, except directly to Company or with the express prior written consent of

        Company.
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        Licensee's obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion of the Confidential

        Information shall terminate when the Licensee can document that: (a) it was in the public

        domain at the time it was communicated to the Licensee; (b) it entered the public domain

        subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Licensee through no fault of the Licensee; (c) it was in the Licensee's possession free of any obligation of confidence at the

        time it was communicated to the Licensee; or (d) it was rightfully communicated to the

        Licensee free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated

        to the Licensee.
